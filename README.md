# PythonDataScience

This repository contains code as part of assignments from an online Python Data Science specialisation.
These are from course 1. 
Viewing the code in github demonstrates that the assignments were completed succesfully, but if you wish to run this code yourself via jupyter lab, please download the 'assets' folder in order for the code to run correctly (it contains neccessary data). 
Please extract the contents of the .zip file within the 'assets' folder (NISPUF17.zip).
