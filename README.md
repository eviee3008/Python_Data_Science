# Python_Data_Science

This repository contains code as part of assignments from an online Python Data Science specialisation.

This code demonstrates use of Python for data analysis, applying packages such as Pandas and matplotlib. This code demonstrates my familiarity with extracting data from sources such as excel spreadsheets, csv files and html files, then cleaning and processing the data using pandas. I used statistical methods to test hypotheses in relation to the data, and also produced data visualisations.

If you wish to run this code yourself via jupyter lab, please download the 'assets' folder in order for the code to run correctly (it contains neccessary data). 
Please extract the contents of the .zip file within the 'assets' folder (NISPUF17.zip). Please keep the extracted file within the 'assets' folder.
